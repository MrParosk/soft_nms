# Soft-nms in PyTorch

Implementation of the soft-nms algorithm described in the paper: [Soft-NMS -- Improving Object Detection With One Line of Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503)

The algorithm is implemented in PyTorch's C++ frontend for better performance.

## Install

Make sure that you have installed PyTorch, version 1.7 or higher. Install the package by

```Shell
pip install git+https://github.com/MrParosk/soft_nms.git
```

Note that the installation process is tested on linux and with anaconda. It might work on other platforms, but are not tested.
